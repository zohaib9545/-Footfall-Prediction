# 🧠 Retail Footfall Forecasting with ARIMA

This project analyzes pedestrian footfall data from Melbourne, Australia, using Python data science tools. It visualizes trends across time, weekdays, and hours, and applies the ARIMA model to forecast future visitor counts.

## 📁 Dataset

We use the **Pedestrian Counting System - Monthly Counts per Hour** dataset provided by the City of Melbourne. Data is fetched directly from:

```
https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/api/v2/catalog/datasets/pedestrian-counting-system-monthly-counts-per-hour/exports/csv
```

## 🧩 Features

* 📊 **Footfall Over Time**
  Aggregates daily pedestrian counts and visualizes the trend over time.

* 📅 **Footfall by Day of the Week**
  Highlights visitor patterns across weekdays.

* ⏰ **Footfall by Time of Day**
  Shows average footfall per hour to identify peak visiting hours.

* 📆 **Monthly Footfall Trends**
  Displays total visitors per month for seasonal trend analysis.

* 🤖 **ARIMA Forecasting (Actual vs Predicted)**
  Implements ARIMA modeling for time-series forecasting and visualizes the model’s prediction against actual data.

* 📈 **30-Day Forecasting**
  Projects footfall for the next 30 days using the trained ARIMA model.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Statsmodels (ARIMA)
* Jupyter Notebook / Python Script

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Footfall-Prediction.git
   cd retail-footfall-forecast
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python project.py
   ```

> **Note:** Make sure your internet connection is active, as the dataset is loaded from a live URL.

## 📊 Sample Visuals

* Daily Footfall Trend
* Weekly and Hourly Breakdown
* Monthly Totals
* Actual vs Predicted Curve
* 30-Day Future Forecast Plot

## 📈 Model Details

We use the ARIMA model with the following configuration:

* **Order:** (7, 1, 1)
* **Frequency:** Daily
* **Forecast Horizon:** 30 Days

The model is trained on the full daily time-series dataset with forward-fill handling for missing dates.

## 🧠 Applications

This project is ideal for:

* Urban planning departments
* Retail store owners
* Data scientists exploring time series modeling
* Students learning ARIMA forecasting
